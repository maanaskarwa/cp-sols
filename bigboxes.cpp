 * Problem statement: https://open.kattis.com/problems/bigboxes

 * Brandon Greg Jr. is moving to the United States to double his salary. He has n items that he needs to pack into k big boxes.
 * The n items are currently arranged in a row, and Brandon doesnâ€™t want to bother reordering them, so he will partition the n items into k groups of consecutive items, and put each of the k groups into their own box.
 * For convenience when moving, Brandon wants to minimize the weight of the heaviest box. The weights of the boxes themselves are negligible.
 *
 * Input:
 * The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^5), denoting the number of items and the number of boxes respectively.
 * The second line of input contains n space-separated integers w_i (1 <= w_i <= 10^4), representing the weight of each item in order.
 *
 * Output:
 * The only line of output should contain a single integer, denoting the minimum possible weight of the heaviest box.
